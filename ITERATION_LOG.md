# MatterShift iteration log

This log captures product critiques that changed the simulator. It is intentionally about the
technician experience, not the host repository's pre-existing research hypotheses.

## Baseline release

The first release established the visual language and one complete XRD shift: an equipment-first
control room, six rendered stations, QC drift, sample-label reconciliation, robot release, an XRD
pattern, an AI proposal, scoring, and an event ledger. Desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts were
verified in the in-app browser.

## Critique 1: one instrument was real; five were scenery

The baseline looked like a laboratory but behaved like an XRD lesson. The BET station was offline
decoration, the furnace and robot had no failure recovery, replay had little breadth, and the AI loop
was only visible at the last decision.

### Changes

- Added a visual shift deck with three independent work orders.
- Added a BET recommissioning shift spanning CMMS evidence, independent lab acceptance, vacuum/blank
  visualization, sample pretreatment lineage, an adsorption isotherm, and an AI synthesis proposal.
- Added a furnace/robot recovery shift spanning controller alarms, interrupted thermal history,
  physical-versus-digital occupancy, empty-cell verification, and AI training-data eligibility.
- Added plausible wrong choices that lower the relevant safety, traceability, or integrity score but
  do not let the simulation silently proceed.

## Critique 2: shared animation told the wrong story

The alternate shifts initially reused the XRD carrier animation. That made the state model visually
false even though the workflow text was correct.

### Changes

- BET now has its own ADS-77 sample route from preparation to gas sorption.
- Furnace recovery shows the initial disagreement between robot state and physical BC-207 location,
  then changes to a held/censored state after reconciliation.
- The active BET analysis ports pulse, while instrument-state colors remain distinct from sample
  eligibility.

## Critique 3: “AI for materials” needed a visible operating loop

An AI proposal at the end of a modal did not show how laboratory evidence enters or blocks an
experiment cycle.

### Changes

- Added a compact PLAN → EXECUTE → MEASURE → LEARN rail to every shift.
- Shows the model request, the technician-owned evidence gate, and the next trusted action.
- Keeps AI downstream of lab truth: proposals can be held, runs can be censored while retained, and
  local characterization can trigger more evidence instead of an automatic recipe change.

## Critique 4: the SEM/EDS handoff ended as paperwork

The XRD shift assigned SEM/EDS follow-up and immediately ended. That missed both a visually rich
instrument and a core expert judgment: local evidence is not automatically bulk evidence.

### Changes

- Extended the XRD shift to a seventh task.
- Added an animated simulated backscattered-electron field, bright-inclusion ROI, local EDS spectrum,
  field-coverage strip, and scale bar.
- Added a representativeness decision: acquire multiple fields and an elemental map, or incorrectly
  report the first high-contrast feature as the bulk explanation.

## Verification discipline

Each branch was exercised in the browser through both correct and incorrect decisions. Visual QA
covered a wide desktop viewport and a 390 × 844 mobile viewport, including the scenario deck and a
stacked instrument workbench. TypeScript, lint, and production build checks are run before publish.
